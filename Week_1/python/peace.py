#Basic usage of print()
print("Hello, world !")
print("Wellcome to python programming.")

# Using print() with variables
name = "Aisha"
age = 25
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)

# Using f-strings with print()
name = "Bola"
score =92
print(f"{name} score {score} in the exam.")

# Using string concatenation
first_name = "Ada"
Last_name = "Lovelace"
print("Full name: " + first_name + " " + Last_name)

# Comma vs concatenation
print("Hello", "world!")     # With comma
print("Hello" + " " + "world!")  # with concatenation
